This project is a webpage/recipe book that contains the recipies for different foods,
and it currently has the recipes for lasagna, chocolate chip cookies, and baked mac
and cheese, with more recipes potentially to come. I mainly built this project to 
test my skills for HTML, which something new that I am trying to learn. This project
uses many various HTML features, such as headers, images, links, ordered and unordered
lists, etc. I tried to cover all of the topics that I had currently learned so far, 
and this project has been a great learning experience to pratice HTML.
