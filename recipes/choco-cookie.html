        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies are the perfect cookie with a soft and moist center, melty morsels of chocolate, and crisp edges. It’s the only chocolate chip cookie recipe you’ll ever need because it’s classic—not fussy, complicated, or time-consuming.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unsalted Butter</strong> - room temperature butter creates the best consistency to trap air for a chewy, airy dough with the best texture and rise.</li>
                <li><strong>Granulated Sugar</strong> - white sugar adds sweetness without adding moisture for the perfect spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Brown Sugar</strong> - molasses keeps the cookie moist, soft, and chewy. Be sure to press the sugar tightly into the cup when measuring.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs</strong> - room temperature eggs mix more evenly to bind the dough.</li>
                <li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong> - store-bought or homemade vanilla extract gives that classic chocolate chip cookie flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>All-Purpose Flour</strong> - be sure to measure correctly to get the right amount: fluff with a spoon and then scoop the flour into the measuring cup. Finally, scrape off the top. Be sure not to pat the flour down.</li>
                <li><strong>Baking Soda</strong> - sift to eliminate clumps.</li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong> - balances the sweetness of the sugars.</li>
                <li><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong> - we prefer semi-sweet chocolate chips, but you can use milk chocolate or bittersweet chips for a slightly different taste.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 350 degrees and cover 3 cookie sheets with parchment paper or Silpat mats. Cream the butter and sugars together for 5 minutes until light and fluffy—this is the most important step to get a chewy cookie. Be sure to beat for the full amount of time!</li>
                <li><strong>Beat</strong> eggs into the butter mixture one at a time followed by the vanilla extract.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine</strong> the dry ingredients (flour, salt, and sifted baking soda) in a separate bowl, and then add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients in thirds. Finally, fold the chocolate chips into the dough. Be sure not to over-mix (this can cause the dough to become tough).</li>

                <li><strong>Roll</strong> balls of dough or use a trigger release scoop to scoop 3 Tbsp balls onto the prepared cookie sheets.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake</strong> one cookie sheet at a time for 12-15 minutes. The tops should still look a bit wet and not browned. We usually bake 1/3 of the cookies at a time and refrigerate or freeze the rest for later, so see our tips below.</li>
                <li><strong>Rest</strong> the cookies on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. Store cookies in an airtight container on the counter for 5 days. To warm the cookies, try toasting in a toaster oven or baking at 350 for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
