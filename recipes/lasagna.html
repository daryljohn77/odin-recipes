        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy Lasagna Recipe is meaty, cheesy, saucy, and packed with flavor in every bite. 
            Homemade lasagna is better than any restaurant version, and it feeds a crowd for way less than going out to eat.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong> - We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna but a lean 
                    ground beef is perfectly acceptable. You can also sub half of the beef with Italian sausage for variety.</li>
                <li><strong>Onion</strong> - we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well.</li>
                <li><strong>Garlic Cloves</strong> - you can add more if you love garlic.</li>
                <li><strong>Red Wine</strong> - This amps up the flavor of your sauce (do not use cooking wine). You can sub wine with beef broth or stock.</li>
                <li><strong>Marinara Sauce</strong> - Use homemade marinara or store-bought.</li>
                <li><strong>Dried Thyme</strong> - Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted.</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar</strong> - balances the acidity of the tomatoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Parsley</strong> - flat-leaf or curly parsley works well.</li>
                <li><strong>Lasagna Noodles</strong> - Cook these al dente; they'll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes. You can also use no-boil noodles.</li>
                <li><strong>Cottage Cheese</strong> - adds great texture and moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Ricotta Cheese</strong> - we use low-fat or part-skim ricotta.</li>
                <li><strong>Mozzarella Cheese</strong> - An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic choice.</li>
                <li><strong>Egg</strong> - helps hold the cheese layer together.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>How To Make The Meat Sauce</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Brown the beef</strong> - Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.</li>
                <li><strong>Finish the sauce</strong> - Pour in 1/4 cup of wine and stir until almost evaporated. Add marinara, salt, pepper, thyme, sugar, and parsley; bring to a simmer, then cover and cook the tomato sauce 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How To Make The Cheese Sauce</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the cheese filling</strong> - Combine all the cheese sauce ingredients and 1 cup of mozzarella in a mixing bowl (reserve the rest for later).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How To Make The Lasagna</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prep</strong> - Preheat your oven to 375ºF and cook the lasagna noodles in a pot of well-salted water until al dente, then drain and pour in cold water to stop the cooking process and prevent sticking.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble</strong> - Spread 1/2 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9×13-inch casserole dish. Add 3 noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 1 cup of mozzarella, and half of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella.</li>

                <li><strong>Bake</strong> - Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned.</li>
                <li><strong>Rest</strong> - Let the lasagna rest for about 30 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
